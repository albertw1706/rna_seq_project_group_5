# Transcriptomic Analysis of Mouse Samples in Response to Toxoplasmosis

## Repository Overview
This GitHub repository is designated for the project that is a part of the RNA-seq course from the University of Bern. The project focuses on identifying differential gene expression in sequenced mouse samples comparing those infected with Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis) to control samples. The repository contains scripts and explanations of the workflow.
